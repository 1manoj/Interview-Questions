# Arrays
1. Given an array of integers and an integer k, find out whether there are two distinct indices i and j in the array such that nums[i] = nums[j] and the difference between i and j is at most k. **[ContainsDuplicate](ContainsDuplicate)**

2. Given a sorted array arr[] and a number x, write a function that counts the occurrences of x in arr[]. **[Count-the-number-of-occurrences-in-a-sorted-array](Count-the-number-of-occurrences-in-a-sorted-array)**

3. Given a string, find the length of the longest substring without repeating characters. **[LongestSubstringWithoutReatingCharacters](LongestSubstringWithoutReatingCharacters)**
  * For example,
    * the longest substrings without repeating characters for “ABDEFGABEF” are “BDEFGA” and “DEFGAB”, with length 6.
    * For “BBBB” the longest substring is “B”, with length 1.
    * For “GEEKSFORGEEKS”, there are two longest substrings shown in the below diagrams, with length 7.

4. Find the sum of contiguous subarray within a one-dimensional array of numbers which has the largest sum. **[MaximumSubArray](MaximumSubArray)**

5. Find the most popular element in int[] array **[MostFrequentInteger](MostFrequentInteger)**

6. Find all N! permutation of the elements of an array **[Permutation](Permutation)**

7. Given a sorted array, remove the duplicates in place such that each element appear only once and return the new length. **[RemoveDuplicatesFromSortedArray](RemoveDuplicatesFromSortedArray)**
  * Do not allocate extra space for another array, you must do this in place with constant memory.

8. Given an image represented by an NxN matrix, where each pixel in the image is 4 bytes, write a method to rotate the image by 90 degrees. Can you do this inplace? (Matrix rotation problem)

9. Write an algorithm such that if an element in an MxN matrix is 0, its entire row and column are set to 0.

10. Given an integer x and an unsorted array of integers, describe an algorithm to determine whether two of the numbers add up to x. (without hash tables) - **[containsSum](containsSum)**

11. Find the Maximum and minimum of an array using minimum number of comparisons. - **[MaxMin](MaxMin)**

12. Given a matrix of m * n elements (m rows, n columns), return all elements of the matrix in spiral order. - **[spiralOrderMatrix](spiralOrderMatrix)**

13. Given an array of unknown size, reverse the positive numbers (before a negative marker) in the array. Ex: [2, 3, 1, 4,-1...] would become [4, 1, 3, 2, -1...]   - **[SegregatePositiveAndNegativeNumbers](SegregatePositiveAndNegativeNumbers)**

14. You are given a square 2D image matrix where each integer represents a pixel. Write a method transposeMatrix to transform the matrix into its Transpose - in-place. - **[transposeMatrix](transposeMatrix)**

15. Given an array of integers, find two numbers such that they sum up to a specific target. - **[coupleSum](coupleSum)**

16. Given that integers are read from a data stream. Find median of elements read so for in efficient way. - **[MedianMaintenance](MedianMaintenance/src)**
